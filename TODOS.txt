- clean up error handling (lots of "ran into an error!")
- remove debug router?
- organize db methods (and add function headers)
- the transactions year dropdown is hardcoded to start from 2020 - we should fetch the oldest year of data
- timeline:
    - selected node becomes filled instead of (Selected) marker
    - allow selection node to be clickable
    - when timeline is longer than the screen width, allow scrolling
    - when card has no transactions in any months should not indicate timeline is still loading
- can add same account multiple times
